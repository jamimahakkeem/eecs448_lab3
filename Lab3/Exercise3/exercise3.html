    <h2>Dobby the Free Elf</h2>
    <img src="dobby.jpg">
    <p>Hi, I am Dobby the Free Elf. I was a  house-elf who served the Malfoy family, but I was granted my freedom by my former master, Lucius Malfoy, so I am now a free elf. I enjoy working and helping Harry Potter and his friends. I have helped Harry Potter countless times by showing him the Room of Requirement to hold Dumbledore's Army meetings and I played an integral part in defeating the Dark Lord. Unfortunately I was murdered by Bellatrix Lestrange when saving Harry Potter and his friends. Here lies Dobby, the Free Elf.</p>
